# SPIFFE and SPIRE

## Yet another CNCF project {% fragment %}

--

## What will this talk cover?

--

* What problems are they trying to solve? {% fragment %}
* What are SPIFFE and SPIRE and where are they going? {% fragment %}
* Where do they come from? {% fragment %}
* A (brief) demo {% fragment %}
* Any drawbacks? {% fragment %}

---

# What problems are they trying to solve?

--

### How do you authenticate and secure workloads in distributed environments?

### RBAC for distributed systems

---


# SPIFFE
<image src="/images/spiffe_logo.png"/>
## What is it?

--

# SPIFFE
* Secure {% fragment %}
* Production {% fragment %}
* Identity {% fragment %}
* Framework {% fragment %}
* For {% fragment %}
* Everyone {% fragment %}

--

## It boils down to three parts

* A standard for services identifying themselves to each other - SPIFFE IDs {% fragment %}

* A standard for encoding SPIFFE IDs in a verifiable document - SVIDs {% fragment %}

* An API spec for issuing and retrieving SVIDs - the workload API {% fragment %}

Note: SVIDs: SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Documents

---

# So if SPIFFE's just a framework what's the big deal?

## This is where SPIRE comes in

---

# SPIRE
<image src="/images/spire_logo.png"/>
## What is it?

--

# SPIRE

* SPIffe {% fragment %}
* Runtime {% fragment %}
* Environment {% fragment %}

Note: Yeah, the acronym's not great...

--

### An open source reference implementation of the SPIFFE spec

Note: Written, of course, in Go

--

## Two components:

* The server - provides a central registry of SPIFFE IDs and the policies describing which services can assume which identities {% fragment %}

* The agent - runs on any machine, exposes the workload API to any process needing to retrive SPIFFE IDs, keys or trust bundles {% fragment %}

Note: Think running agents on every node in your K8s cluster to allow pods to retrieve an identity

--

## What does this look like in practice?

--

## Super Exciting roadmap

* JWT-SVIDs - Support JWT based SVIDs {% fragment %}
* Federation - Support federating trust domains {% fragment %}
* High Availability - Cluster multiple SPIFFE servers within a single trust domain {% fragment %}
* Revocation - Revoke x509 SVIDs over the Workload API {% fragment %}

Note: this roadmap tracks behind the SPIFFE/other roadmaps pretty closely

---

## Where do they come from?

--

### Both projects under the auspices of the CNCF

Note: Currently (as of July 2018) in Sandbox phase of CNCF adoption - accepted into the CNCF in March 2018

--

## Initial idea taken from Google - Joe Beda is the original author of SPIFFE

## Most of the work is being done, in the open, by a company called Scytale

## Intent to support this with a maintained and supported implementation of the standard

Note: This shouldn't be a surprise, Scytale's founders/current CEO include engineers from Google Cloud Platform, AWS and other big name companies with a keen interest in security

---

# Live demo time!

---

### Sounds great!

### Any drawbacks?

--

## Well, a few...

--

* They're both pre-alpha and the specifications therefore aren't yet stable {% fragment %}
  * Although... they're actually very clear about this {% fragment %}
* Security isn't convenient - but this isn't exactly new {% fragment %}
* Suddenly your implementation of SPIFFE is a single point of failure - your SPIFFE server falls over and services can't talk to each other anymore {% fragment %}

Note: Whether this actually counts as a drawback depends on your point of view... I'd rather have this than istio's constant claims to be ready for production...

# Thanks!

## Any questions?
